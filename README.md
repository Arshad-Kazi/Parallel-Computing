# Parallel-Computing

Following is our team project on parallel computing. We have done parallel implementation of ensemble algorithms viz. Bagging, A-Bagging, Stacking and A-Stacking. We have also trained a RNN based encoder network (feature extractor) on twitter hate speech detection and classified the extracted feature vectors using our ensemble algorithms. Parallel algorithms show a boast of 3x in speed.
